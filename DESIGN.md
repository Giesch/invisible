# Space Jammin'
##General Idea
* Reference games: Faster Than Light, Lovers In a Dangerous Spacetime
‘Invisible’ as a concept of only seeing your immediate surroundings
* Setting: Space
* Goal: Delivering some valuable information
* Means: Traveling a galaxy
* Obstacles: Enemy / Pirate Ships, Asteroids, Planet Gravities
* Core game play
    * Given a backstory and mission the player will find themselves traversing a galaxy with a general direction (eg. Near the blue planet, in the NE sector of this galaxy, etc..).
    * Base: There should be an identifiable base that spawns on the outskirts of the planet.
    * Intel: There may be some useful intel that can be picked up on the map.
* Obstacles:
    * Asteroid belt (if time)
    * Enemy clusters (near a homeworld?)
    * Rogue enemies
    * Stray asteroids
